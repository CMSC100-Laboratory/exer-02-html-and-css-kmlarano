Steps on creating a GitHub Page:
1. Assuming that you already have the files that you want to deploy, make sure that the html file is named as "index.html". 
2. Create a repository, public if you are not using GitHub Premium. 
3. Upload your code to the repository
4. Go to the settings tab of your repository, then look for pages on the left sidebar, under build and deployment select "deploy from a branch" for your source, then select the appropriate branch.
5. Wait for it to upload, after a while you will see the url for your page. And you're done!

Takeaways:
Creating a website from scratch is hard, I struggled with choosing the design for this activity. Which is why I resorted to a minimalist approach, using a monochromatic theme. I also tried to copy some design elements from other works that I've seen from the internet, but alas, my implementation isn't as clean as what I would've hoped for. Creating it was a very fun experience, and I would love to keep creating more in the future, so that I can hone my skills further.
